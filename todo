now:

- rename "scheduler" to "archiver"
  start reimplementing the archiver
  - [ ] creating an archive request (ONLY ONE-OFF ARCHIVES FOR NOW)
    - [x] grpc server
    - [x] grpc proto for requesting an archive
    - [x] creating entry in the database
    - [ ] triggering an archive process for that created archive
  - [ ] processing an archive request
        that doesnt actually do anything yet
  - [ ] process first type of archive request
      youtube SINGLE video
  - [ ] process video downloads
  - [ ] process first site of for video download
      youtube
  - [ ] add support for youtube playlists
  - [ ] add support for youtube channels
  - [ ] add support for niconico SINGLE videos
  - [ ] add support for niconico tag searches
  - [ ] add support for bilibili SINGLE videos
  - [ ] lock down the inputs of the URL
        because the URL has significant implications, we should lock it down a
        bit early on and then think about how to make our URLs work nicely

later:

- webapp: archive requests page
- new queue system
  make it so new archive requests get processed immediately, and rechecked
  depending on the last checked date in the db
- archive requests - oneoff vs persistent
  some things i'll want to archive as a one-off archive, while i'll have some
  that i'd like to keep as a persistent archive loop
- nginx as reverse proxy for everything
- things like youtube support (although honestly, let's just make it so we can
  feed arbitrary links to youtube-dl for processing)
  so we're not restricted to very specific types of archive requests
- something more proper for the frontend since im a sucker for webapps and not
  server side rendered pages
- retry failed downloads of scheduled videos



minio and postgres
- be able to tell when the data is initialized
  we'll use the volume, creating two directories in it, one for data and one for state

  state would be our persistent tracking of data state
  data would contain... the data

running migrations after startup - not worth fixing
  since i'd like the server to be unavailable until after the
  migrations have run

  well, fucking, duh, you can just start the server on a different port in the dockerfile,
  run the migrations, and then start the server on the regular port!
